            <li>3 tablespoons of butter</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons of minced shallots</li>
            <li>Salt, to taste</li>
            <li>1 1/2 cups of diced mushrooms [Optional]</li>
            <li>1 tablespoons of all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons of cognac or brandy</li>
            <li>1/2 cup of whole milk</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons of creme fraiche or heavy cream</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon of chopped fresh tarragon</li>
            <li>Cayenne pepper, to taste</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons of fine dried bread crumbs</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons of freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons of melted butter</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Steps</h4>

        <ol>
            <li>Cut the bottom shell of the lobster tails using kitchen shears along each side where it meets the top shell; do not remove the shell at this point.</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>Melt 2 tablespoons of butter in a skillet over medium-high heat. Place lobster tails cut side down in the butter. Cook, covered, about 3 minutes. Turn lobster tails
                over [they are curved so will lean to 1 side]; cover and cook for 1 minute. Lean them to the other side; cover and cook 1 minute more.
            </li>
            <p></p>
            <li>Remove from heat. Transfer lobster tails to a bowl. Remove any shell pieces from the skillet</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>Place 1 tablespoon of butter in the skillet over medium heat; add shallots and a pinch of salt. Cook and stir until pan starts to deglaze and shallots soften, 3 to 4 minutes.
                Add mushrooms; cook stir until golden brown, 5 to 6 minutes. Add flour; stir until mushrooms are coated and cook for 2 minutes. Pour in cognac; use a kitchen torch to flame
                cognac to burn off alcohol. This will take just a few seconds. Add milk; cook and stir until pan is completely deglazed and milk begins to thicken and turn bubbly, about 2 
                minutes. Remove from heat. Stir in creme fraiche. Let cool.
            </li>
            <p></p>
            <li>Remove lobster meat from the shell, leaving top shell intact. Remove any bits of the bottom shell from the meat.</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>Preheat oven to 450 degress F [230 degrees C]. Line a baking pan with crinkled up foil. Make 4 channel-like indentations in the foil to hold and stabalize the lobster tails as
                they bake.
            </li>
            <p></p>
            <li>Slice lobster meat down the middle and check for and remove any dark veins. Chop into 1/2-inch pieces. Transfer meat to a mixing bowl. Add cooled sauce, terragon, a pinch of salt,
                and cayenne pepper. Stir gently until well blended.
            </li>
            <p></p>
            <li>Divide mixture among the lobster tail shells; place in prepared foil-lined pan. Sprinkle each lobster tail with about 1/2 teaspoon bread crumbs and 1/2 teaspoon grated cheese.
                Drizzle melted butter on the stuffed shells.
            </li>
            <p></p>
            <li>Bake in preheated oven until nicely browned and heated through, about 10 minutes. If you like, you can turn on the broiler and broil 1 minute until tops are golden and crispy.</li>
        </ol>
