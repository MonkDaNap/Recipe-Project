            <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
            <li>3 pounds skinless, boneless chicken thighs, cut in half</li>
            <li>8 (12-inch) jumbo wooden skewers</li>
            <li>1 large fresh pineapple - peeled, cored, and sliced</li>
            <li>20 (6 inch) corn tortillas</li>
            <li>¼ cup roughly chopped fresh cilantro</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Steps</h4>

        <ol>
            <li>Heat a skillet over medium-high heat. Add dried chiles; cook, turning occasionally, until toasted and blistered in spots, 3 to 5 minutes. Add 1 cup water to just cover the chiles, 
                and bring to a simmer over medium-high. Cover and cook, undisturbed, until softened, about 5 minutes. Drain well.</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>Combine chiles, achiote, garlic, chipotles, 2/3 cup onion, orange juice, vinegar, oil, cumin, brown sugar, and salt in a blender; process until smooth, about 30 seconds. 
                Reserve 1/2 cup marinade, cover, and refrigerate until ready to use.
            </li>
            <p></p>
            <li>Place remaining marinade in a shallow dish or large resealable plastic bag, add chicken; toss to evenly coat. Cover chicken with plastic wrap, and refrigerate at least 8 hours 
                or up to 24 hours.</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>Place wooden skewers in a shallow dish; cover with water by 1 inch. Let stand at room temperature while chicken marinates.
            </li>
            <p></p>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Position oven rack 8 inches away from heating element. Line a small roasting pan or 13- x 9-inch baking dish with aluminum 
                foil.</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>Thread 1 pineapple slice onto 2 skewers, being sure to pierce through the center core, (skewers will be about 1 inch apart), leaving a 1 1/2-inch space from end of skewer. 
                Thread 5 to 6 pieces of marinated chicken, stacking on top of pineapple; thread 1 pineapple slice. Repeat process, ending with pineapple slice, until all chicken pieces and 
                pineapple slices are used, making 4 stacks total. Brush with any remaining marinade from chicken.
            </li>
            <p></p>
            <li>Place stacked skewers in the prepared pan, resting skewer ends on edge of pan so that the chicken doesn't touch the bottom of the pan.
            </li>
            <p></p>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 30 minutes. Flip skewers over, brush with reserved 1/2 cup marinade. Bake until chicken is no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, 
                about 30 minutes longer. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 160 degrees F (71 degrees C). Increase oven temperature to broil; broil until browned and 
                crispy, 3 to 5 minutes. Flip, and broil until browned and crispy, 3 to 5 minutes.
            </li>
            <p></p>
            <li>Meanwhile, heat a large skillet over high heat. Working two at a time, add tortillas; cook, turning once, until heated and browning in some spots, 1 to 2 minutes per side. 
                Repeat with remaining tortillas.</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>Remove chicken and pineapple from skewers, place on cutting board, roughly chop.</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>Divide chicken and pineapple between heated tortillas; top with remaining onion and cilantro.</li>
        </ol>
